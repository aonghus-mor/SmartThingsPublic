This is a device handler for the Secure SRT323 Thermometer, based on that written by @meavydev for the SRT321.
After the device has connected to the hub click the wheel symbol (top right) to go to the preferences page.   The required information is:
1) The name of the device and an icon which will appear in the middle of the main screen.
2) The wakeup interval.  This should be at least 600 seconds.  The device saves battery power by waking up every so often to collect and execute any commands which have been set in the meantime.   A smaller value uses more battery power, but a larger value implies a long delay between something changing in the device handler, such as the temperature setpoint, and the device responding.
3) The minomum change of temperature to be reported back to the device handler.   Again a small value implies more frequent reporting and thus more battery usage.

The device may be used in conjunction with @meavydev's scheduler (https://github.com/meavydev/SmartThingsPublic/tree/master/smartapps/meavydev), designed for the SRT321, or any other scheduler.  
It can also be set from within various SmartThings routines, such as "GoodBye" and "I'm Back"   
In each case a temperature (an integer value) setpoint is chosen.   The term 'setpoint' is used for the temperature which the thermostat is set to achieve.  
THe term 'temperature' is used for the measured temperature.

Note that the temperature scale, Celsius or Fahrenheit, is set for the location in the smartthings app.

The dashboard tile contains a button (top left) which can be used to toggle the thermostat mode between 'heat' and 'off'.

When the mode is set to 'off' it is equivalent to setting the temperature setpoint to 5 celsius.  This is to protect the system from freezing.

The Device handler itself shows 5 tiles:
1) the current temperature 
2) the temperature setpoint.  This can be adjusted up and down by one degree.
3) the thermostat mode.  'heat' for normal operation. 'off' for frost protection.
4) the operating state.  This has the value 'heating' or 'idle', whether the boiler is firing or not.
5) the battery state.
